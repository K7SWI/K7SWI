              The South West Idaho Amateur Radio Club Inc. (SWI-ARC) is a
              501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded in 2018 by a group of
              local amateur radio enthusiasts from Nampa, Idaho.

              Our club was created to offer both experienced hams and those
              curious about amateur radio a welcoming space to come together
              regularly—at least once a month—for hands-on activities that build
              skills and foster community. Our group events include Parks on the
              Air (POTA) activations, Field Days, fox hunts, and collaborative
              projects such as antenna and kit builds.
              <br />
              <br />
              In addition to these activities, we hold a monthly educational meeting
              focused on practical topics like “Event Communications” and “Building
              a Battery Bank.” These sessions often include live demonstrations and
              hands-on practice. Can’t make it in person? Most meetings are livestreamed
              on our Facebook group, so you can join the learning wherever you are.
              <br />
              <br />
              SWI-ARC also actively utilizes our operating privileges to help protect
              our spectrum space. We’ve invested in building an AREDN mesh network
              and operate repeaters on the 220 MHz and 900 MHz bands. Some members
              explore advanced frequencies in the 5cm and 13cm bands, with planned
              activities and learning sessions to support these interests.
