Dave NQ6S and Rob KW2E is trying to put together a concerted effort for the September VHF contest which is Sept 11 and 12, 2021 and this will be our event for September. To do this they will need home stations around the area listing in on the VHF+ simplex frequencies and some Rovers willing to travel to try and make contacts from as many grid squares as possible. This should be a lot of fun. For anybody that is interested in being on the Rover team, contact Dave at NQ6S@Centurylink.com. Emails will also be on the club reflector at swidahoarc@groups.io, and the Facebook page will be used. Dave also monitors 146.52 regularly.
