We will be operating on May 22 and May 23 as a special event station commemorating the approx 100 year anniversary of the Chicken dinner that gave Chicken Dinner Road. Over the last few years Chicken Dinner road has had a lot national publicity because of a letter from People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) to the mayor of Caldwell, asking to have the road renamed to make it "celebrates chickens as individuals, not as beings to kill, chop up, and label as ‘dinner.'” "We will be operating under our club call on K7SWI. For all the locals the event will have a free (donations accepted) chicken dinner that will be served at 5:00pm local time.

The location for the event is on some private property off of Chicken Dinner road (has a Chicken Dinner Road address if it had an address). If you are headed south on Chicken Dinner Road it is the first multihouse driveway south of Lloyd Lane and North of Locust Lane headed to the West towards the river. There is a large shop/warehouse on the east side of Chicken Dinner Road just south of the driveway. Once you turn west on the driveway, go to the corner, follow it to the left, then go to the next intersection and turn right, then park on the left you will have a hard time missing us and we are visible from Chicken Dinner Road. We plan to be operational from noon local time on 5-22 until 18:00 UTC noon local time on Sunday 5-23. We will have stations on all the major VHF/UHF calling frequencies for the locals. Send a SASE for a QSL card and $1.00 if you wish a certificate for the event.
