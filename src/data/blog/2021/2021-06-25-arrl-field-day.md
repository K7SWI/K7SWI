Field Day update. Early set up Friday afternoon/evening. Hamburgers, Lumpia and corn on the cobb Saturday at 5p with donations to the club accepted The club will have cold water, unsweetened ice tea, and lemonade on hand. Please bring a covered side dish or salad if you are able. Two grills available. Forecast calls for 100 on Sat and 104 on Sun. Plenty of shade around the pool and no shade in the RV parking area. The back yard slopes down from the house and the RV parking area slopes even more so bring your trailer levelers. As you can see from the Google Earth pic there is only one way in and out of the main RV parking area. A UTV will be available to move people and equipment up and down slope. What to bring - camp chairs, popup shelter for shade, towel. As a reminder please no dogs, no glass in the pool area, and babies in swim diapers. We will also have a covered area for buy, sell, trade ham radio related items. 73 Scott W7IMC

Simple directions to find the location. Take Franklin exit in Nampa head south into town. Stay in the right hand lane. Follow the road to the right on 11 ave. Move into left hand lane. Go under the overpass, then when the lane turns left on 3'rd, go left, then go right on 12'th as the lane goes. Follow the road about 4 miles until you get to Deer Flat. Turn right. Travel a few miles until you get to the top of the ridge and you see the entrance to DeerSky Ranch on the Left. Turn left on Deer Sky Ranch Trail. Follow it until you meet Deer Ridge Trail. Turn left. Follow the road until you see some antennas and lots of people lol.
