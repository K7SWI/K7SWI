The May meeting will have a presentation by Scott B W7IMC on doing POTA and SOTA activations. And maybe some chasing as well. POTA is short for Parks on the Air. In the pota world a park is any federal or state park, wildlife refuge or national forest. Lots of people love pota because it gets them out of the house into a lower rf noise environment to operate. Sota is Summits on the Air, which are mountain tops. Both of these organizations of great web sites with lots of info on the rules and awards available.
