We will be setting up for the Idaho QSO party on the morning of March 12, and will operate as a parks on the air activation until the QSO party starts. Dinner will be at about 5pm and everybody is invited. We will sign up for 2 hour slots to operate the radioâ€™s. There will be at least three stations going hopefully the full time, all operating on different bands. Stations will not be allowed to change bands without coordination with event control to make sure we are not causing issues with ourselves. Here is the link to sign up for a guaranteed time slot
