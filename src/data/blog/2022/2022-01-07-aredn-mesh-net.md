We are working on setting up an AREDN network in the Treasure Valley Area. We have a few nodes up and running and are working on getting them connected. We need more people to setup nodes.

Aredn is growing now in the treasure Valley. We have three nodes setup at peoples homes that are connected together with a tunnel and currently have 2 repeater sites that we will be placing hardware on. One on Squaw Butte and another lower level site we can't advertise yet. If anybody is willing to donate equipment or funds for equipment it would be greatly appreciated. We are working on getting access to sites high enough to serve the whole treasure valley with a mesh network that is separate from the internet and based on solar power so they will function if the internet or power goes down. We also want to have some mobile stations that can be deployed to different locations when needed.

We currently have a facebook group where we do most of the discussion, which you are free to join South West Idaho AREDN
