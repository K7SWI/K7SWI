We will be meeting on Saturday December 10 at the Golden Corral in Nampa. 3:30 pm. There will be a door prize raffle, 50/50 raffle, Club Awards given out and a White Elephant gift exchange. You don't have to participate in the White Elephant, but it should be fun. Please limit the cost of gifts to $20.
