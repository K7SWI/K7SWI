It is that time of the year again. Time for our Winter VHF+ simplex contest. 1-7-2023 from 10 am to 4pm, work as many stations on VHF+ simplex. Each contact is worth one point. You get multipliers by working stations in different grid squares. Two classes Rookies, who are licensed less than 2 years, or have never participated in a VHF contest, and unlimited.

You can work each station once per band.

Full rules will be linked soon.
