June 18, is ARRL Kids day, so lets get kids on the air. We will setup at the Caldwell side of Lake Lowell hopefully at the pavilion area. We will setup at 11:00am with lunch at 1pm. This is also a Pota location so we will be activating the park as a POTA as well.

Please bring any kids that you know are interested in radio. They will be able to get on the air and talk to people, hopefully all the way around the world.
