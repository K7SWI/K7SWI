April 9'th fox will be turned on at 10am. Lunch will be served after the hunt at the finish line. If you want to meet before the event starts and get written rules/clues, come to the Nampa School District Office at 625 S Canyon in Nampa at 9:45. Or if you don't think you need the rules/clues just tune into 147.450 for the high powered fox, which you should be able to hear from most areas of the treasure valley. The fox is someplace in Canyon county east of Karcher rd HWY 55, South of the Freeway and North of the River. This is a large area so use your tools and skills to limit where you search. There will also be a lower powered fox that is turned on at the same time on 146.565. The low powered fox only has 150 mw so you might not be able to hear it from all of the Treasure Valley.
