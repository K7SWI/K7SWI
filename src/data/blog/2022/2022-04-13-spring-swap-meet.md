South West Idaho ARC is sponsoring a swap meet on May 7'th from 9 am to noon. This is a parking lot swap meet to be held at the 10 Mile Christian Church on the corner of 10 Mile and Franklin. Please bring your own table or tailgate. We will have access to the building for bathrooms. The SWIARC will bring their club trailer with some antennas, power meters and power to test equipment if you wish you use it.

A map will be provided before the event to let you know what part of the parking lot we should be using. Just get it on your calendars.
