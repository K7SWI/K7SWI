## How We Participate

As a club, we often travel to a nearby county that’s **infrequently worked** during the contest. This not only gives us the thrill of being in high demand but also earns us **bonus points** for activating a rare location.

Once we set up, it’s non-stop radio action:

- Working pileups of stations eager to log our county  
- Running portable stations and testing different antennas  
- Logging every contact to maximize our score  

It’s an energizing experience that blends **teamwork, skill, and friendly competition**.
