**Parks on the Air (POTA)** is one of the most exciting and accessible activities in amateur radio. Whether youâ€™re operating as part of a group or on your own, POTA is all about heading out to a park, setting up your gear, and making contacts with other hams from around the world.

## Two Ways to Join the Fun

Getting started with POTA is simple, and there are two main ways to participate:

- **Activator** â€“ Head out to a designated park, set up your station, and make contacts with other operators. Youâ€™ll be the one everyone is trying to reach!
- **Hunter** â€“ Stay at home or operate from your regular station, making contact with activators in the parks. This is the easiest way to get started.

Most people begin as hunters, since you donâ€™t need to pack up your gear or leave home to participate.

## POTA with SWI-ARC

Our club organizes **group POTA outings several times a year**, often combining radio fun with a BBQ or other social gathering. Sometimes weâ€™ll even **activate multiple parks in a single day**, working together to log as many contacts as possible and help each other improve our portable setups.

These outings are perfect opportunities to:

- Learn portable operating techniques  
- Try out new antennas and radios in the field  
- Meet and work alongside other hams  
- Enjoy Idahoâ€™s great outdoors
