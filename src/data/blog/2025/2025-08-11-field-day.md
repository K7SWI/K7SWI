If youâ€™re curious about amateur radio, **this is one of the best times to visit**.

## ARRL Field Day

**ARRL Field Day** is often called *ham radioâ€™s open house*. Every June, more than **31,000 amateur radio operators across North America** set up temporary transmitting stations in parks, fields, and other public spaces to demonstrate ham radioâ€™s **science, skill, and service**.

Field Day combines:

- **Public service** â€“ Practicing communication skills for emergencies  
- **Emergency preparedness** â€“ Operating in temporary setups without relying on the power grid  
- **Community outreach** â€“ Introducing the public to amateur radio  
- **Technical skills** â€“ Setting up antennas, radios, and logging systems in the field  

This tradition has been going strong since **1933**, making it the most popular event in amateur radio.

## Winter Field Day

**Winter Field Day** takes place on the **last full weekend of January** and brings an extra layer of challengeâ€”and excitementâ€”to field operations. Hosted by the **Winter Field Day Association**, it encourages hams to practice portable communications in **cold-weather conditions**.

Why winter? Because snow, ice, freezing temperatures, and other hazards pose unique operational challenges that are worth preparing for. Whether you operate solo, with a friend, or as part of our clubâ€™s group station, Winter Field Day is a great test of skill and teamwork.
