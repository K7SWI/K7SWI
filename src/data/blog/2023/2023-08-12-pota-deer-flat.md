Pota party at Deer Flatt WMA. We will start on all bands at around 11 am, please bring something to share for lunch. Also bring your antennas to tune we will have a few antenna analysers to help tune your end fed half waves and other wire antennas. The park has lots of trees to hang wire from as long as we are careful.

August 19, 2023, Caldwell Boat Dock Park off of Riverside. Take hwy 55/Karcher road west from the freeway to Riverside, turn Left, then when you see the Park sign pull into the park and turn left until you see the pavallion, that is where we plan on setting up.
