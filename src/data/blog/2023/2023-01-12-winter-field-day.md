The SWI ARC will be setting up for Winter Field day at Bonneville Point off of Blacks Creek Road just east of Boise off of I-84. The public is welcome to come by and see what it is all about.

If you want to make sure you can operate a station please sign up via Signup Genius to make sure you can get on the radio. This does not mean you will not get on the radio, but priority will be given to those people that signed up for a slot.

We will have a pot luck dinner around 4pm with hot chili and stew. Please bring a side to share. This is also a POTA site so you can get credit for Pota as well as Winter Field Day.
