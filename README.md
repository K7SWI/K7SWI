# K7SWI - South West Idaho Amatuer Radio Club Website

This is the official website for the Southwest Idaho Amateur Radio Club (K7SWI).
It provides information about club events, repeaters, nets, educational resources, and ways to get involved with amateur radio in the Southwest Idaho area.

The site highlights our monthly meetings, leadership gatherings, contest participation, Parks on the Air activities, and Field Day events.
It serves as both a resource for current members and an invitation for anyone interested in learning more about ham radio to join us.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

The project is built using Astro.js and Tailwind CSS. Here's a quick look at the project structure:

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
